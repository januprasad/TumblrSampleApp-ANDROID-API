Android: This is a demonstration of how to set up read/write capabilities to Tumblr.

MainActivity will have most the info that you need to include, although you should also look at the Manifest.

Additionally, in order to post to tumblr, you will also need to:
1. Register your application on Tumblr to get the consumer key and secret.
2. Download and add the jumblr.jar to the library, and add it to the build path.
3. Download and add signpost-commonshttp4-1.2.1.1.jar, and signpost-core-1.2.1.1.jar, and add to build path.

For the purposes of this demo, you should also have a file on your android device that contains a few photos.
